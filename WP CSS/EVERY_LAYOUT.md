# Applying Every-Layout Principles

## Box

There isn't an area to apply this on a global scale, since WordPress core blocks all have
independent code (although, we could do something like common.css - which may be the appropriate solution).

These have to be applied to _individual block css_.

### Basic CSS
```css
.box {
  padding: var(--s1);
  border: var(--border-thin) solid;
  --color-light: #fff;
  --color-dark: #000;
  color: var(--color-dark);
  background-color: var(--color-light);
}

.box * {
  color: inherit;
}

.box.invert {
  color: var(--color-light);
  background-color: var(--color-dark);
}
```

## Center

Replacing ```.wp-container-{$id}``` autogenerated css classes with global center property works well, when using the non-intrinsic center
version, such as:

```css

.wf-container {
 box-sizing: content-box;
}
.wf-container > * {
 max-inline-size: 42.5rem;
 margin-inline: auto;
 padding-inline: var( --wp--style--block-gap, 1rem )
}
.wf-container > .alignwide {
 max-inline-size: clamp(48.5rem, 62vw, 96rem);
}
.wf-container .alignfull {
 max-inline-size: none;
}
.wf-container .alignleft {
 float: left;
 margin-block-start: var( --wp--style--block-gap, 2em );
}
.wf-container .alignright {
 float: right;
 margin-block-end: var( --wp--style--block-gap, 2em );
}

```

Center largely works as a smart default for content size replacing ```.wp-container-{$id}``` classes.
However, _intrinsic_ centering is overly opinionated for this global that wraps every block.

_Intrinsic center_ is more appropriate on the block level, as adding:
```php 
// Overall class, give it flex props. This isn't in core, it might cause goofiness.
		$style = "$selector { display: flex; ";
		$style .= 'flex-direction: column;';
		$style .= 'justify-content: flex-start;';
		$style .= '}';
```

To the wf-container master code results in everything within that container matching content size, rather than
actual full width in areas that would be intended (such as a group block with background color) although it might
be a better approach to use intrinsic centering in a sub class.

Much of the issue is that text itself becomes centered by default, rather than justified left, etc.

# WordPress Default CSS

##General CSS cheat sheet

```div > *``` selector = selects all elements where parent is div.

```div > * + *``` 
The adjacent sibling combinator `'+'` is only applied where the element is preceded by another element.
The universal (wildcard) selector `*` ensures any and all elements are affected.

``` * + *``` is knows as the owl.
```css
* + * {
	margin-top: 1.5em;
}
```
[The OG reference to Owl Selector](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/)

When the element is ```div > * + *``` it ensures that only children are affected.
```div * + * ``` is _recursive and will inject the css into every element at all nesting levels._

Would read as "All elements in the flow of the document that proceed other elements must receive a top margin of one line."

##WordPress Generated CSS

[This File](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/99bac7e17cfb5d534b33ffc3a70bff9d9b86875d/wp-includes/class-wp-theme-json.php) contains ```WP_Theme_JSON``` which autogenerates Custom Props and default body styles.

##Body Tag

```html
<body class="home 
page-template-default 
page 
page-id-4 
wp-custom-logo 
wp-embed-responsive">
</body>
```

### User Custom Templates
When a user creates a template, it saves as a CPT and renders the following CSS class:
```page-template-wp-custom-template-{$template_name}``` 


##Block Template wrapper
[WordPress Generates wp-site-blocks as a wrapper](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/99bac7e17cfb5d534b33ffc3a70bff9d9b86875d/wp-includes/block-template.php)
```html
<div class="wp-site-blocks">
    <!-- template files appear here, 
    e.g. <header>, post_content, <footer> -->
</div>
```
Within the body tag, there is a div wrapper that has the site-blocks inside, e.g:
```html
<body class="<!-- reference body tag notes above-->">
    <div class="wp-site-blocks">
        <!-- hidden SVG files here for accessibility -->
        <header class="wp-block-template-part"></header>
        <div class="wp-container-* entry-content wp-block-post-content">
            <!-- the_content -->
        </div>
        <footer class="wp-block-template-part"></footer>
    </div>
</body>
```

### .wp-container-*

This class is autogenerated with a unique ID and is setting values such as spacing. Renders with max-width, margins, floats
and uses ```> *``` and ```> * + *``` selectors.

Wraps the following blocks:
- Columns
- Group

Any block that can inherit site width properties from theme.json gets this bloat.

--This-- CSS is autogenerated by php, _not by a css file enqueued._

```wp_render_layout_support_flag()``` & ```wp_get_layout_style()```

The wp_render_layout_support_flag function renders an entirely **new id** via php's uniqid() every single time
the page is rendered or refreshed - and has existed since version one. I can't think of a single reason as to _why this_ 
even exists. 

When the wp_render_layout_support_flag() is removed via remove_filter('render_blocks') and replaced with a different
custom function that uses the same name, it still works - however, using a different one where it references the same
CSS class file currently does not.

The only logical explanation for _why a unique id_ exists is so that if the user has a custom setting for wide and content size
that it properly renders as a lazier alternative to an if() statement that would only create a unique id if the user has 
inputted a unique value for that particular block.

Larger example:
```css
.wp-container-61f5a9d413d0b > * {
 max-width: 42.5rem;
 margin-left: auto !important;
 margin-right: auto !important;
}
.wp-container-61f5a9d413d0b > .alignwide {
 max-width: clamp(48.5rem, 62vw, 96rem);
}
.wp-container-61f5a9d413d0b .alignfull {
 max-width: none;
}
.wp-container-61f5a9d413d0b .alignleft {
 float: left;
 margin-right: 2em;
}
.wp-container-61f5a9d413d0b .alignright {
 float: right;
 margin-left: 2em;
}
.wp-container-61f5a9d413d0b > * {
 margin-top: 0;
 margin-bottom: 0;
}
.wp-container-61f5a9d413d0b > * + * {
 margin-top: var( --wp--style--block-gap );
 margin-bottom: 0;
}

```

Renders all 7 of the above if the block is set to alignfull OR if alignwide. IF content is inside the block.
If it's an empty block, then only the 4 props that don't include max-width load. 

If the setting is alignwide, then only the 4 load. If empty then loads all 7?


### .wp-site-blocks

Mostly blank, wraps *all* block content. Default CSS rendered:
```css
.wp-site-blocks > .alignleft {
 float: left;
 margin-right: 2em;
}
.wp-site-blocks > .alignright {
 float: right;
 margin-left: 2em;
}
.wp-site-blocks > .aligncenter {
 justify-content: center;
 margin-left: auto;
 margin-right: auto;
}
.wp-site-blocks > * {
 margin-top: 0;
 margin-bottom: 0;
}
.wp-site-blocks > * + * {
 margin-top: var( --wp--style--block-gap );
}
```
